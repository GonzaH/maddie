Hi, I'm ***m.a.d.d.i.e***, the Masks Automated Discord Dice Interpreter & Explainer!

Syntax is as follows - `move+/-label`
`!engage+3`
`!support-2`
If you're using a playbook or custom move not covered here you can use `!other+1`

I will be quieter if you prefix with !! (once you're comfortable with the detailed results) e.g. `!!unleash+2`

Type `!moves` to see the short version of help.
Type `!moves+` to get a more detailed explanation of all moves (labels etc.).
Type `!playbooks` to see all supported playbooks

***Basic moves***
e.g.
`!engage` - DIRECTLY ENGAGE A THREAT
`!unleash` - UNLEASH YOUR POWERS
For more type `!moves`

***Playbook moves***
e.g.
`!creepin` - STRAIGHT UP CREEPIN
For more type the name of the playbook e.g. `!beacon`

***Adult moves***
e.g.
`!wield` - WIELD YOUR POWERS
For more type `!adult`
